    <h3>How does paint actually dry?</h3>

  <div class="unimportant">

      <p>
      The solvent evaporates away when the paint dries. This leaves the pigment and oil behind. The oil oxidises to form a hard film. This happens because the oil reacts with oxygen in the air.  Pigments are coloured substances used in paint. Paints are a type of mixture called a colloid. They contain several components, including the pigment, a solvent and a binding medium.
      Thermochromic and phosphorescent pigments are very useful, and extend the normal properties of paints.</p>

      Paints are used to decorate surfaces or protect them from damage. A pigment is a coloured substance used in paint.</p>


    <p>
      Paints contain these ingredients:
      <ul>
        <li>a pigment - gives the paint its colour.</li>
        <li>a binding medium - a liquid polymer that hardens to form a continuous layer when the paint dries.</li>
        <li>a solvent - dissolves the binding medium and makes the paint more fluid.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
